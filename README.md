# HealthFirst (Patient) — React + Tailwind Web App (No Backend)

This project is a working UI-only prototype based on your Figma screenshots:
- Login page (Patient)
- Registration page (same theme)
- Patient Dashboard (layout matching your design)

## Tech
- React (Vite)
- TailwindCSS
- No backend (demo auth uses localStorage)

## Run locally
1) Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

2) Start dev server
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Demo credentials
- Email: `patient@healthfirst.test`
- Password: `Password123!`

## Notes
- Registration creates/stores a demo user in localStorage and logs you in automatically.
- Update colors/fonts/spacings to perfectly match your Figma once you share the full link or exports.
